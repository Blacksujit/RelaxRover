ðŸ§¢ A sticker sheet will be sent to the creators of the first 100 valid submissions. Also, a "Quira Creator" hat will be sent to the 5 creators that... we'll keep this rule secret until the end of the Quest!

To claim a prize, make sure you follow the rules!

The content you submit to the quest must be original.
You are allowed to generate code with LLMs and to use StackOverflow, but the app/repo idea must be yours and yours only. If we detect plagiarism from other repo or user, your submission will be marked and you won't be eligible for a prize.
Your project must have a README and must clearly explain what the project does and how someone can run it or install it.
Team submissions are not supported in this quest.
You can only submit one repo. If you make a mistake, you have to remove the repo and upload a new one.
You can submit repositories used in a previous quest, provided they implement a new feature. The new feature should be described in the comments.
